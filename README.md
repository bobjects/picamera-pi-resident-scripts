# PICAMERA - pi-resident scripts

Raspberry Pi camera control scripts, used for capturing timelapse video, real-time video, and still images, using a Raspberry Pi and Raspberry Pi camera module.  The files in this repo are the BASH scripts that run on the Raspberry Pi itself.

See [this blog post](https://www.bobjectsinc.com/tinycomputers/raspberry-pi-camera-software-part-1/) for a description of these scripts.
